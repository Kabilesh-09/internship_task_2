# CyberSecurity_Task2_PhishingAnalysis

This repository contains a contrived phishing sample and a detailed analysis report for **Task 2: Analyze a Phishing Email Sample** (Cyber Security Internship).

## Contents
- `phishing_sample.txt` — Safe, non-functional example email saved for analysis (do NOT click links or open attachments on a host machine).
- `Phishing_Analysis_Report.md` — Detailed analysis, findings, remediation steps, and interview Q&A answers.
- `screenshots/` — Visual mockups showing the email view and header analysis (for submission visuals).

## How to use
1. Review `Phishing_Analysis_Report.md` for the full walkthrough and findings.
2. Do not click any links or open attachments; this sample is educational and non-functional.
3. If you need to perform deeper attachment analysis, use an isolated VM with snapshots and no network connectivity.
