--- Visible link text vs actual href (do NOT click) ---
Visible link text: Verify Now
Actual href: http://paypal.security-update.example.fake/verify?uid=ABC123

--- Attachments (do NOT open) ---
invoice.docm  (macro-enabled Word document)  -- placeholder name, DO NOT open on host machine

--- NOTES FOR ANALYSIS ---
- Sender address uses a visually similar domain 'paypa1.com' (digit '1' instead of 'l') which is a common typosquat technique.
- Headers include an SPF fail line (illustrative) indicating the sending IP is not authorized by the visible domain.
- No DKIM signature present.
- Link domain (paypal.security-update.example.fake) is not the legitimate paypal.com domain and mixes subdomains to appear legitimate.
- Email uses urgency ("within 24 hours") and threat of loss of access — classic social engineering.
- Generic greeting ("Dear Customer") rather than user name — another phishing indicator.

--- SUGGESTED METADATA FOR YOUR REPORT ---
Sample ID: sample-001
Picked for: Contains spoofed sender, mismatched links, urgency language, and an attachment (recorded but not executed)
How obtained: Generated for training by ChatGPT (safe example)
Risk level (for exercise): High (multiple phishing indicators)
